# Project F
 A GitHub repo to keep track of our fallen meme gods. Press F in the chat bois.
# Why though?
 
 Okay, so this idea came to me while browsing r/dankmemes. If you don't know this subreddit then this repo is not meant for you.
 
 Idea is to have a safe and open place to put our fallen meme lords in a safe place so that when our kids grow old they will know about our rich r/dankmemes culture. /s
 
 # Contribution
 
 I would like my fellow redditors to help me in this project by sending PRs. If you don't know about opensource then please head over to this guide https://opensource.guide/ Just kidding, you can make a PR suggesting why the meme that is no more among us physically shall be included. We start with a big empty canvas and add our beloved memes to it one by one, according to the day the tragedy happened. For eg., Stephen Stephenson(forever number one) will come before grumpy cat which we recently.
 
 The project is in it's initial state. Expect low activity but as soon as we grow, this shall be a holy place for our gods.
 
 # Support
 
You can support this project by contributing. No, seriously. I was late to the r/dankmemes jourey and couldn't experience most of our meme gods when they were alive.
